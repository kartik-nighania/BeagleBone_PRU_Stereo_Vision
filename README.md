# BeagleBone_PRU_Stereo_Vision
to output stereo depth images using image capture from PRU of OV7670 module and using OpenGL ES2 for stereo depth images

Aim is to have continuous Image acquisition in real time using two cameras separated by a small distance  by PRUs and creating stereo depth video to be used by terrestrial robot and aerial drones. 

Stereo vision has an edge over other techniques due to its ability to provide three dimensional information about the environment and better decision making as to how obstacles can be avoided for safe navigation through the environment. 


Presently the most famous stereo camera we have is kinect made by microsoft XBOX widely used in motion gaming and robotics.

 Use of stereo vision in robotics and its shortcomings in real time behaviour-
 The amount of interest in the field of implementation of robotic systems for tasks like-
Indoor automation
Driverless transportation and Unknown environment exploration
Gesture sensing and gaming
have increased exponentially among the community of researchers and hobbyist.
